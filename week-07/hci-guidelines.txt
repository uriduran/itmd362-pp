# Production Problem 5: Implementing HCI guidelines for touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either Apple/iOS, Android, or Windows, redesign the login page at
http://my.iit.edu/ for a touch-friendly environment.

You only need to sketch your redesign, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/
* Android Design Guidelines:
  http://developer.android.com/design/index.html
* Windows Desktop Guidelines:
  https://dev.windows.com/en-us/desktop/design

## Deliverables

Fine-grained, atomic commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2) an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guidline One (URL): https://www.google.com/design/spec/style/color.html#
* How you implemented it in your sketch: I really like Android color scheme. They use very bright and vibrant colors, I
think this goes well with the iOS guideline of using a lot of negative space. I attempted to put highlights into the top menu
to draw the users attention and let them know there is also an information tab while also keeping the rest of the login UI white
to allow the rest of the page to focus on its main job (the log in.)

* HCI Guidline Two (URL): https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006556-CH66-SW1
* How you implemented it in your sketch: I attempted to use the Depth guideline here in the top menu bar of the website.
I have the pages set up to look like they are stacked on top of each other. This is very similar to how Chrome's tabs look in iOS.
When switching between pages the one the user is currently on will change color and make the appereance of having been brough infront.
I think this only works if there are two options. Any more and the UI could get messy. 

* HCI Guidline Three (URL): https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dn742462.aspx
* How you implemented it in your sketch: Even though this link talks about Desktop applications I tried following their guidelines for simplicity.
I think apple also does this very well. The first and main page of my redesigned log in screen has only the most necessary and basic elements: The log in fields.
As it says on Microsofts site to attempt to eliminate the unecessary. That is why I split the log in page into two tabs. The first and landing page is the login and nothing more.
If the user wishes to find other useful (debatable) information on the IIT page they can then choose on their own to visit that tab.
