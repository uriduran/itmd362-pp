# Production Problem 7: Usability Checklists

## The Problem

Usability checklists are typical, and sometimes mindless, tools/magic tricks used to find usability problems in web and other digital projects. What you are going to do for this Production Problem is to locate at least 2 different usability checklists of at least 25 items (use Google, but challenge yourself to go beyond the first page of results). From those lists, create your own, condensed list of exactly ten items. Share with your group for Project 3 to help yourselves create your own master usability checklist.

## Deliverables

* URLs for the usability checklists you've found:

* Your own condensed, ten-item must-have usability checklist:

1. Quick site load-time is a must.
2. Website must get to the point as soon as it loads. (aka Important information, point of website is easily viewable or accessible without tons of clicking.)
3. Simple, easy navigation. No convoluted menus, etc.
4. Unobstrusive ads, pop-ups.
5. Fonts, colors, must be clean and make it easy to scan for information.
6. Consistency across all pages. (Menus are in same place, fonts are standardized, etc.)
7. Able to be viewed on mobile devices as flawlessly (or even better) than on desktop. 
8. Content is readable without a stylesheet.
9. If large website include search bar (looking at you my.iit.edu)
10. Personalized features (currency, language, date format) based on users location.
