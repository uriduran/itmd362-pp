# Production Problem 4: Color Palettes for HCI

## The Problem

Using either Adobe Color CC (https://color.adobe.com/), Paletton (http://paletton.com/), or another
Web-based palette generator of your choosing, you will create a number of different color palettes,
based on the requirements in the Deliverables section below.

## Deliverables

Fine-grained, atomic commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) screenshots of your web-based palette for the four palettes below;
2) an explanation, after each palette request below, why you chose the colors you did

* A monochromatic palette for a website that creates high-end, custom-made gaming laptops.

Explanation of your color choices: I went with a red monochromatic color because I've seen a lot of gaming websites use it.
It is probably due to the fact that Red + Black creates a sense of danger and and sleekness. Personally I would use a black
background, with white text and then use the pallete for accenting and headings. My second choice would have been a blue pallette
with maybe a white or black background. I think red and blue are the most common palettes for gaming and computer websites because
they're the most favorite "boys colors" and that's the general demographic for those things.

* A shaded color palette for a website that sells natural and organic foods.

Explanation of your color choices: I think the stereotypical thing here to do is use shades of green. However, I thought that was
a little too overdone and went with a light blue shade pallete. The reason for this is that you can use it against a white background
and create a sense of freshness as people may associate the light blues to water and spring. There is also some darker blues in there 
to be used for headings.

* A complementary palette for a banking website.

    The UID is here: 20Q050kkVFUpM++oKWGc2tR2Je6
Explanation of your color choices: For this scheme I went with a warm color inviting color like yellow. My thought process here
is that this will create a welcoming color scheme that invites the user and makes the bank seem friendly. Then this also meant
that it's complimentary color would be a blue palette. Which works well for sections where its a bit more serious. Maybe the bank portal
can be the yellow palette but once logged in it changes to a white-blue scheme since its a bit more proffessional and serious.

* A triadic palette for a website that offers games for children.

Filename:Triad.PNG
Explanation of your color choices: I picked the basic colors: yellow, red, and blue. Since these are both bright colors with a lot of energy
and they are also the colors that we first learn. The age of the children is not specified but I had in mind maybe primary school aged children.
I attempted to make the colors a little bit softer, almost pastel like colors because I thought just having pure red, blue and yellow would be 
a bit obnoxious.
