# Production Problem 4: Color Palettes for HCI

## The Problem

Using either Adobe Color CC (https://color.adobe.com/), Paletton (http://paletton.com/), or another
Web-based palette generator of your choosing, you will create a number of different color palettes,
based on the requirements in the Deliverables section below.

## Deliverables

Fine-grained, atomic commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) screenshots of your web-based palette for the four palettes below;
2) an explanation, after each palette request below, why you chose the colors you did

* A monochromatic palette for a website that creates high-end, custom-made gaming laptops.

Explanation of your color choices: I went with a red monochromatic color because I've seen a lot of gaming websites use it.
It is probably due to the fact that Red + Black creates a sense of danger and and sleekness. Personally I would use a black
background, with white text and then use the pallete for accenting and headings. My second choice would have been a blue pallette
with maybe a white or black background. I think red and blue are the most common palettes for gaming and computer websites because
they're the most favorite "boys colors" and that's the general demographic for those things.

* A shaded color palette for a website that sells natural and organic foods.
